Hello, and thank you very much for purchasing this asset!


I have moved all the documentation to the web, where you can find 
detailed information about both versions of the asset (basic and full),
and up-to-date examples with videos, and new questions answered,
all in English and Spanish.

It's all here: http://www.damian-gonzalez.com/portals/


If the online documentation doesn't solve your issue and you need my 
assistance, you can contact me:

However, here you have offline "HOW TO USE" instructions.


Implementing this asset is very simple. Let's see 3 ways to do it:


_______________________

a. From the demo scene

After purchasing and importing the asset, go to the folder:
Assets > Damian Gonzalez > Fluid Seamless Portals > Demo > Scenes

You can open the first scene, called "General Demo", and simply press Play. 
Just like that, you should be able to explore everything the asset offers. 
And of course, you can build your game around this scene.

If you are using a URP or HDRP project, you'll find this folder:
Assets > Damian Gonzalez > Fluid Seamless Portals > Core > Pipelines conversion

And inside it you have packages for converting the materials to the pipeline you are using.


_______________________

b. From your own scene

Or, of course, if you already have a scene, you can add the portals to it.
This is very easy, just go to the prefabs folder:
Assets > Damian Gonzalez > Fluid Seamless Portals > Core > Prefabs > Sets of portals

and drag any of the prefabs into your scene.
As children of the portal set, you will see 2 individual portals (A and B).
You can place them wherever you want and rotate them however you want.
(But be careful to manipulate these two objects ("portal A" and "portal B") and not their children. This could cause unwanted effects)

...And that's it!


_______________________

c. From scratch


If you want to build it from scratch, it's easy too. Follow these steps:

1) If you don't have one, create a new Unity project

2) Download and import the asset

3) Create 2 different places, even if they are just floors.
For example, create 2 cubes, with a scale like [20, 1, 20], and make them different in some way 
(otherwise you won't notice if you you teleported) as a different color, or add some object to differenciate them.

4) Now drag a set of portals into your scene (see above) and place one in each location

5) Drag a player from "Prefabs > Player" folder, and place it in one of the rooms

That's all. Press play and have fun!
