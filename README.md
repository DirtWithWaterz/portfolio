After Life -
    All by me, besides any imports of course.

Chess -
    School project, all writen by myself, taking a course on youtube for some guidance in my learning. All of the networking was done by myself, and the majority of the code. This is the playlist I used for guidance, I then made a 2d game with the information I learned. (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmcbjnHce7SeAUFouc3X9zqXxiPbCz8Zp)

LED -
    A project I worked on with a friend.

The Water is Deep -
    Done by myself, one of the first little things I ever put together. Not exactly amazing, but I think the code implimentations were interesting.

Xanthophobia -
    There was potential in this, it fell off after the unity project corrupted, tried to redo as much as I could but eventually gave up, used to have ai that could hear and understand the player through voice chat and recognition, could find the player by hearing their mic as well. Used to have a nice movement system that I put together, less so now. Also had a procedural dungeon generator I made, which I lost. Might still be in there, can't remember.

@#$^&!#% -
    A game on a console, it's fully functional. Has a tiny dungeon to explore. type "help" for a list of commands on starting the game.

Mic-Movement-Planet-Flashlight -
    I know my names are so original, this is where I made the microphone sensitive ai, Made the smooth movement, and a pretty cool flashlight. Also a really pretty planet with a star behind it. The star moves to simulate an orbit if I remember correctly.
    I also built a voice recognition system, try saying "come in command, Can you hear me? Over." or just "can you hear me?".
